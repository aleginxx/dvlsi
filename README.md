Github repository of DVLSI Projects in VHDL.

## Collaboration with ECE-NTUA:
Lab Partner : Zoe Genakos

# Overview
This repository contains the lab projects conducted in relation to the dvlsi course, using Xilinx Vivado 2018.3. 
The main focus of these projects is to :
- Familiarize oneself with the usage of the Vivado program for simulations and for on chip applications
- Acquire proficiency in writing VHDL code with precision and efficiency

### Projects Overview:
- Constructing multi-bit adders, shift registers and multipliers
- Implementing an FIR filter and applying it to ZYBO
- Designing a Debayering filter for NxN images and applying it to ZYBO
